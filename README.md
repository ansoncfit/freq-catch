# freq-catch

Catch-all repo with various tools for processing/analyzing frequency-based GTFS, including: 

- Simple jupyter notebook for writing CSVs of the GTFS stops served by specified routes (e.g. to map catchment areas served by frequent routes, such as in [this blog post](https://blog.conveyal.com/access-in-seattle-fb5ef952c3ae))
- R scripts to download batches of raster travel time surfaces and extract contours
